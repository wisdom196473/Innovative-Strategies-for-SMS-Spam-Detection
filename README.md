# Innovative-Strategies-for-SMS-Spam-Detection

### Objective

Leverage machine learning to develop a predictive model capable of accurately classifying SMS messages as either spam (unwanted messages) or ham (legitimate messages).

### Challenge
It lies in creating a model that can effectively differentiate between these two categories with high precision and recall, using the SMS Spam Collection dataset, which comprises a set of SMS tagged messages specifically collected for SMS Spam research.
