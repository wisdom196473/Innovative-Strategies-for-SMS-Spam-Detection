# Innovative-Strategies-for-SMS-Spam-Detection

### Objective

Leverage deep learning to develop a predictive model capable of accurately classifying SMS messages as either spam (unwanted messages) or ham (legitimate messages).

### Challenge
It lies in creating a model that can effectively differentiate between these two categories with high precision and recall, using the SMS Spam Collection dataset, which comprises a set of SMS tagged messages specifically collected for SMS Spam research.

### SMS Spam Dataset

* The SMS Spam Collection dataset consists of ~190K English SMS messages, each labeled as either spam or ham, sourced from various online platforms for research purposes.

* The dataset's composition reflects a real-world distribution of spam and ham messages, providing a solid foundation for model training and evaluation.
